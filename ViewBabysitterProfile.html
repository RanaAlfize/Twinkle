    <p>Hi there! I'm Anjali. I recently earned my degree in early childhood education from Autumn College, and I have been caring for children for 6 years as a babysitter and as the oldest of four siblings. I have a lot of experience working with infants and toddlers, and I also spent three years babysitting a six-year-old girl on the autism spectrum. I truly love working with young kids, and I approach each child as an individual who I get to help grow and teach.

        Nothing makes me happier than running into someone who I used to babysit and remembering all the fun times we had together! I'm available on weekdays until 6:30 p.m., and I have the flexibility to work four weekend days each month. I can provide references upon request. I'd love to meet you and get to know your children.</p>
